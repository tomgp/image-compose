This is an [Electron JS](https://electronjs.org) based application. When given a directory containing a bunch of images it will display two of them, at random, side by side. There are some keyboard commands that let you change the images ...

 * __E__ changes the right hand image 
 * __Q__ changes the left
 * __W__ changes both
 * __-__ reduces the margins
 * __=/+__ increases the margins

If an image pairing appears and you particularly like it you can press 

 * _P_ to save save it to list of favourites
 
You can scroll down to see the currently selected favourite parings. Each one will have a 'Remove' button next to it to remove it from the list. The list is automatically saved in the images directory as a file called 'faves.json' so that when you restart the app you can review all the parings already saved.

I think that's about it.
